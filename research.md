## Coffee
### Shelf Life
Notes: 

"Moisture-resistant sealed packaging with a minimum of oxygen content is the key to coffee shelf life."

 - Oxygen at 20%
 - Temperature at 20-25Â° C
 - Moisture content not more than 2.5% and water activity at about 0.3
 - Sample not exposed to excessive light


One way valve bags appear to be the best bet in transporting coffee.
